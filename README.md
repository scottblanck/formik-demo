# React with Formik sample code with Yup validation

This project contains formik code and some sample forms for React. It was initially created as an inhouse project for our dev team to quickly build forms. Feel free to use it.

There is also Formik-MUI integration using the Formik hook. We integrated some of the strengths of Formik with MUI components. Very useful.

# To use these components:

npm install formik

npm install yup (used for form field validation, docs here - https://github.com/jquense/yup)

npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
